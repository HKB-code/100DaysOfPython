#Complete the script so that it prints out a list containing letters d, e, f.
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]
# d  has an index of 3  here, e  has an index of 4 , and f  has an index of 5, but since the slicing syntax is upper-bound exclusive, we need to pass 6  as the upper bound.
print(letters[3:6])
# the term upper-bound exclusive means that the upper limit specified in a range or sequence is not included in the output.
